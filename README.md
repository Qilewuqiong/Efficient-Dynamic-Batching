Code from our paper Effective Approaches to Batch Parallelization for Dynamic Neural Network Architectures.

If you are interested in experimenting with dynamic batching speedups:
 - The MOE file can be used to reproduce our Mixture of Experts experiments
 - The Net file can be used to train Johnson et. al's IEP CLEVR model. Note the difference between cell time and forward pass time. See our paper for details.
 - This readme will be updated and cleaned shortly within a few days of arxiv publication (7/11). In the meanwhile, the code is quite clean and should not require additional documentation. However, we welcome edits/suggestions.
